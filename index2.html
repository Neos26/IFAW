                    <p class="index2_paragraph">Australia has a koala emergency. Koala populations along the east coast
                        of
                        Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) are plummeting towards extinction and are on the country’s
                        endangered species list. Populations in Victoria and South Australia, despite not being
                        officially
                        endangered, face shocking decline.</p>
                    <p class="index2_paragraph">The root cause in both cases is the same—habitat loss. But the symptoms
                        are
                        vastly different. In Queensland and NSW, koalas are scarcely seen because their habitat is so
                        fragmented, driving down their numbers.</p>
                    <p class="index2_paragraph">Further south, numbers only tell half of the story. Particularly in
                        Victoria’s southwest, koalas can easily be spotted. But many are starving and emaciated.
                        Thousands
                        of others are living in swathes of private blue gum plantations, where they’re at risk of death
                        every single day.

                        the

                        IFAW and the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). A leading factor in the incredible success of this

                    <p class="index2_paragraph">In the wild, Asiatic black bear cubs are typically weaned at four
                        months,
                        but they often stay with their mothers for about two years. Found in the Sagalee region of Papum
                        Pare district by the Arunachal Pradesh Department of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Papum
                        was
                        only one month old when he was rescued, so he needs round-the-clock specialised care.

                    <p class="index2_paragraph">Luckily, the IFAW–Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) Centre for Bear
                        Rehabilitation and Conservation (CBRC) is here to help. Across northeastern India, poaching of
                        black
                        bears is unfortunately a common occurrence. The cubs of poached mother bears often die alone,
                        while
                        others are captured for zoos or the exotic pet trade. As a result of these and other threats,
                        Asiatic black bears are classed by the IUCN as a vulnerable species. The goal of CBRC is to
                        rehabilitate these orphaned cubs and prepare them for a successful release back into the wild.

                    <p class="index2_paragraph">Problem <br>
                        Birds of prey are protected by law in China. Still, too often, they’re victims of environmental
                        degradation and illegal wildlife trade.

                        When they’re not captured, killed, or otherwise threatened, they may end up with serious
                        injuries,
                        like bone fractures, broken wings and bullets lodged in their bodies.

                        In Beijing, part of the major migratory route for raptors, we needed an institution to rescue,
                        rehabilitate, and release these wounded birds back into the wild.
                    </p>
                    <p class="index2_paragraph">Solution <br>
                        In 2001, we partnered with Beijing Normal University and the Beijing Forestry Bureau to open the
                        Beijing Raptor Rescue Center (BRRC).

                        The BRRC team treats each bird with the utmost care to ensure their survival in the wild. In
                        addition to rescuing individual birds, BRRC also shares best practices with law enforcement and
                        wildlife rehabilitators around the country.

                        deaths. Since NOAA declared an Unusual Mortality Event in 2017, there have been 41 documented

                        whale deaths, 37 serious injuries and 70 morbidities, which represents over 35% of the current
                        North
                        Atlantic right whale population. Further, research suggests that that only 1/3 of right whale
                        deaths
                        are
                        documented, so the death toll is likely much higher. In comparison, there have only been 88

                    <p class="index2_paragraph">The issue starts with Japan leaving the International Whaling Commission
                        (IWC) in 2019. This is the governing body that ensures fair and sustainable management and
                        conservation of whales around the world. Shortly after, Japan resumed commercial whaling,
                        focusing
                        their sights on annual hunts for 187 Bryde’s whales, 142 minke whales, and 25 endangered sei
                        whales.
                        These numbers are concerning for these species, many of which continue to hang in the balance.
                        Whales are colossal ecosystem engineers—all life on the planet depends on them to some extent.
                    </p>
                    <p class="index2_paragraph">Then in May 2024, Japan announced it would expand its commercial whaling
                        operations to include the fin whale. This species was severely depleted after decades of
                        historic
                        whaling activities. While their numbers have improved since the IWC’s moratorium on commercial
                        whaling, they are still classed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Japan’s decision doesn’t
                        just
                        undermine global whale conservation efforts; it also exacerbates the plethora of wider threats

                        storing it in the ocean and landscapes where they live, making a significant contribution to

                    <p class="index2_paragraph">Around the world, many of the biodiverse landscapes where wild animals
                        have
                        the
                        greatest potential to sequester carbon are also landscapes where people are highly vulnerable to
                        the
                        effects of climate change. From the rainforests and cerrado of Latin America to the Congo Basin,
                        and
                        from the savannahs of East and southern Africa to the rainforests of Southeast Asia,

                        Indonesia is an epicenter for natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, earthquakes,
                        and
                        landslides. When these disasters strike, marginalized people and animals tend to be hit hardest
                        and
                        feel
                        the impacts of the disaster longer. Remote communities are often left on their own to prepare
                        for,
                        respond to and recover from disasters, although they rarely have access to the resources and
                        support
                        to
                        do so. <br>

                    <p class="index2_paragraph">Solution <br>
                        Communities near Mt. Agung live at constant risk of natural disasters. To help mitigate this
                        “new
                        normal”, IFAW and BAWA initiated a pilot project focused on helping two remote communities on
                        Mt.
                        Agung
                        build resilience and prepare for future disasters. By working directly with community members
                        and
                        local
                        government, we are able to imbed disaster risk reduction into village level systems that ensure
                        all
                        members of the community are prepared long-term. </p>

                        40 countries around the world. We rescue, rehabilitate, and release animals, and we restore and

                        solve
